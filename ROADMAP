				ROADMAP FOR LOG2TIMELINE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the official dynamic and constantly flexible roadmap for log2timeline.

This roadmap is the current status of the roadmap and is in no way the final one, and can be changed dramatically very suddenly, 
or by implemented accordingly.  That being said, this is a dynamic roadmap, which represents the current ideas about the development
of the tool. Despite it's constant changes and updates it gives a pretty good picture of where log2timeline is headed and
what to expect in coming releasese.

Version 0.62
	- Add a feature to l2t_process - have a parameter that can be used in conjunction with the keyword search so that the timeline
		actually includes not only the timestamps of a keyword hit but also to include events in temporarl proximity (eg 5 or 10 min apart)
	- Add a feature to log2timeline - allow two time zones to be defined, one (the old one) that defines the time zone of the files/image/machine
		in question, and the second one that defines in which timezone you would like the output to be in. (this would allow people to have
		the timeline outputed in GMT even though the original image is in another timezone)
	- Add a feature to write all timestamps in UTC (not the chosen time zone)
	- Add the possibility to choose list files, yet skip a module or add one just the same
		So in the -f list: IN,-OUT (IN could be a name of a module or a list file, and OUT would be a module that is to be excluded)

Version 0.62
	- fix the ShellBag addition to ntuser, make it work properly (disabled in version 0.51)
	- Add more IE Cookie support (parse the text files instead of only index.dat file)
	- Add a module for Thumbs.db file
	- Add more specific registry key parsing (software + system)
	- Add a one-to-one mapping between the timezone information provided by the registry vs. the one that is defined in DateTime
		THE TOOL ITSELF
	- Add a more broken down part of the description field into the timestamp object (thus making new output modules possible)
	- Go through some optimization
		- Mostly involves checking if DateTime can be replaced by other functions somewhere along the line
	- Add Unicode support (should be there, but just to improve it), and especially to "fix" importing timeline into Excel.... (might need UTF-16)
		OUTPUT MODULES
	- Create a new XML output module, using standard and optional fields (built around the timestamp object)
	- Add a more broken down part of the description field into the timestamp object and create a new SQLite output module
	that takes advantage of it, thus creating a separate table for each source type

	- Either to add a Cygwin detection or to include some disclaimer in the installation instructions to Windows users that have Cygwin that they
	do not need to remove the pcap module if they install it there
	
	- Test l2t_process in Windows, look at C Pogue emails and figure out if the "scatter plot" is broken in Windows.

Version 0.63
	- l2t_process
		- change into Python (and do a bit of a design before proceeding, this could turn into a monster)
		- use Matplotlib to plot the scatter plot directly
		- Add any .exe files that reside in the temporary directory to the timeline (very suspicious)
		- Add the keyword itself into the notes field (to see why there was a hit)
		- Create new timeline, with the keyword hits and then 45 (changable) lines above and below the keyword hit
	- pre-processing
		- Add some more libraries into the pre-processing portion
	- log2timeline engine	
		- Add a threaded version? as an option?
	- Add Java IDX files
	- Add Opera history file support (binary files)
	- Add some Plist parsing, add Mac OS X artifacts into the tool
	- Add an input module for Word documents (older versions)
	- Take a look at threading once again

Version 0.64 (network files add-on)
	- Add an input module for Cisco ACL entries
	- Add an input module for IPTables firewall entries
	- Fix the PCAP input module (collect connection information from TCP)

Version 0.65 (anti-virus log files)
	- Add input modules for various anti-virus engines

Version 0.66 (remote administration log files)
	- Add input module for various remote administration tools (logmein, pcanywhere, vnc, ...)

Version 0.67 (mail box)
	- Add support for MBOX files (input module - Mail::Box::Mbox )
	- Consider adding other mailbox support (consider to use a C library for PST/OST files, write a XS Perl library to map between)
	- Add MSN history files
	- Add Yahoo messenger history files
	- Add other IM's (Skype chat for instance)

Version 0.70
	- Add the capability to provide aliases for each input module (so that input modules can be called by their 
	aliases as well as their real names)

Version 0.80
	- Add an update mechanism to log2timeline (the possibility to update the input and output modules directly 
	without the need to update the entire tool)
		Basically to create a module manager, where you can add or remove modules at will
