Usage:
    log2timeline [OPTIONS] [-f FORMAT] [-z TIMEZONE] [-o OUTPUT MODULE] [-w
    BODYFILE] LOG_FILE/LOG_DIR [--] [FORMAT FILE OPTIONS]

Options:
    -s|-skew TIME
            Time skew of original machine. The format of the variable TIME
            is: X | Xs | Xm | Xh, where X is a integer and s represents
            seconds, m minutes and h hours (default behaviour is seconds)

    -m TEXT Prepend the filename with the TEXT. That is TEXT is a string
            that is prepended in front of the file name to provide a path.
            Examples are -m C: to prepend the C:/ in front of each file name
            to indicate the partition the file came from.

    -f|-format FORMAT
            Use the following log file format to parse the content of the
            file. Use -f list to see the list of supported log files.
            Omitting this options make log2timeline attempt to guess the
            format.

    -u|-upgrade
            Check the latest available version of log2timeline and compare
            it to current version (use to check if there is an available
            update)

    -name HOST
            Define the host name that the information is extracted from.

    -o|-output FORMAT
            Use the following output format. By default log2timeline uses
            the CSV output. To see a list of all available output formats,
            use -o list

    -w|-write FILENAME
            Specify a file to write output to (otherwise STDOUT will be
            chosen).

    -z|-zone TIMEZONE
            This option defines the timezone that was used on the computer
            that the log files belonged to. The default value for this
            variable is the local timezone of the computer log2timeline is
            run on. There is an option to define -z list to get a list of
            all available timezones.

    -log FILENAME
            Specify a file to write error and information messages from the
            log2timeline to a file, otherwise STDERR will be used.

    -c|-calculate
            If this option is used then a MD5 sum is calculated for the file
            and stored in the timestamp object

    -x      Make log2timeline skip some more detailed tests to see if a file
            truly is in the correct input module. The tool should work
            faster with this option, however it might miss some files.

    -e|-exclude LIST
            A comma separated list of files to exclude from the scan. If a
            particular file has caused the tool to crash or not work, or you
            simply want to exclude some documents from the scan it is
            possible to exclude some

    -r|-recursive
            This option makes log2timeline work in a recursive way, the same
            behaviour as timescanner.

    -p|-preprocess
            If log2timeline is working in recursive mode (-r) it is possible
            to use the -p option to run a set of pre-processors agains the
            image file. Preprocessors are modules that search through the
            suspect drive and extract needed information that can be used in
            other modules, such as hostname, etc.

    -v|-verbose
            Add debugging information. Possible to use with -v -v to
            increase some error messages.

    -V|-Version
            Display the version number

    -h|-help|-?
            Display this help message

    Better description can be read in the man page of the program (man
    log2timeline).
