<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><strong>log2timeline</strong> takes a log file (or a directory) and parses it to produce a body file that can be imported into other tools for timeline analysis.  The tool has both a modular based approach to the input file as well as the output file.  The current version supports exporting the timeline in a several different body formats.  <strong>log2timeline</strong> is build as a series of scripts, this one being the front-end, which uses other scripts to actually parse the log files (called format files). The tool is build to be easily extended for anyone that wants to create a new format or an output file.</p>
<p>As noted above the default output mechanism is in a CSV file format, which can be easily imported into spreadsheet applications, and parsed by the tool <strong>l2t_process</strong>.  The output format can be easily changed with the -o parameter.  The output module can be set to output in a body format that needs to be imported into another tool for human readable format, or it can be implemented to print the timeline directly in a human readable format.</p>
<p>The tool is build using multiple so called input modules.  Each of those input modules provide a single format that can be parsed, whether that is a log file or a directory containing some files that need to be parsed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the tool is to provide a single tool to parse various artifacts that are either produced by the suspsect operating system or other systems that might have some logs retaining to the investigation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
<p>Furhter description of the parameters</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="s_skew_time2" class="item"><strong>-s|-skew TIME</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Time skew of original machine. It is added (or subtracted) from each time (ctime,atime,mtime,crtime) in the bodyfile to compensate for different time in some log files from the &quot;correct&quot; time.  The format of the variable <strong>TIME</strong> is:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="x_xs_xm_xh" class="item"><em>X | Xs | Xm | Xh</em></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Where X is a integer and s represents seconds, m minutes and h hours (default behaviour is seconds)
It is possible to prepend <strong>TIME</strong> with a minus sign (-) to indicate that the time skew is a negative number.</p>
<p>Example of this usage is: <strong>log2timeline</strong> -t 1243 (a time skew of +1243 seconds is added to each time)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="m_text2" class="item"><strong>-m TEXT</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prepend the filename with the <strong>TEXT</strong>.  That is <strong>TEXT</strong> is a string that is prepended in front of the file name to provide a path.  Examples are -m C: to prepend the C:/ in front of each file name to indicate the partition the file came from.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="d_detail2" class="item"><strong>-d|-detail</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Some input modules have the capability to include very detailed amount of information (such as MFT and prefetch). This switch will instruct modules to include those details in the timeline, so for instance to tell the MFT module to include the $FN timestamps, or the prefetch one to include loaded DLLs.</p>
<p>By default the MFT input module will only include the $STANDARD_INFORMATION timestamps, not the $FILE_NAME. This is due to the fact that in most cases these timestamps may not matter as much. However, especially in intrusion cases, these timestamps play a valiable role. Therefore this option exists to indicate to the tool that it should include the $FN timestamps in addition to the $SN ones.</p>
<p>The same goes with the prefetch module. It can potentially include information about all DLLs each prefetch loads up. This might be a very useful information to have when dealing with malware cases, but it might be too much details in most cases. Hence this is omitted now by default, unless the -d parameter is set.</p>
<p>The setupapi input module also includes lot of verbose text that can be reduced to make the timeline more concise. This information is now by default omitted in the timeline unless this parameter is turned on.</p>
<p>So this parameter tells input modules to include more detailed information about the events. Not all input modules will honor this option, however more might come, and by default this option is not set.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="u_upgrade2" class="item"><strong>-u|-upgrade</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Check the latest available version of <strong>log2timeline</strong> and compare it to current version (use to check if there is an available update).  What this option does is to fetch a file <a href="http://log2timeline.net/VERSION,">http://log2timeline.net/VERSION,</a> which contains a single number, which reflects the latest released version of the tool.  This version number is then compared to the tools version number to find out if there is a new version available on the official site.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="f_format_format2" class="item"><strong>-f|-format FORMAT</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p><strong>log2timeline</strong> has the capability to automatically detect the format of the log file.  If this option is omitted log2timeline will attempt to guess the source file format.  However the behaviour can be overwritten with this option.  So if the -f parameter is set the tool will only use that input module to test against the log file.</p>
<p>It is possible to either define a single input module, list of them or a name of a list file that contains a list of input modules to use.</p>
<p>To get a list of all available input modules use the option of -f list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="name_host2" class="item"><strong>-name HOST</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Define the host name that the information is extracted from.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="o_output_format2" class="item"><strong>-o|-output FORMAT</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Use the following output format.  By default <strong>log2timeline</strong> uses the CSV output.  To see a list of all available output formats, use -o list</p>
<p>This option works the same way as the format file option does (-f) in the way that it searches the output folder for a file called FORMAT.pl and uses that to print the output that has been generated previously by the format file.  The tool dies if the script FORMAT.pl does not exist or is of the wrong format (with an exit code of 13).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="w_write_filename2" class="item"><strong>-w|-write FILENAME</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The standard way to output the bodyfile or timeline is by using standard output (STDOUT).  That can be overwritten using this option to redirect the output to a file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="v_verbose2" class="item"><strong>-v|-verbose</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Add debugging information</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="z_zone_timezone2" class="item"><strong>-z|-zone TIMEZONE</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option defines the timezone that was used on the computer that the log files belonged to.  The default value for this variable is the local timezone of the computer <strong>log2timeline</strong> is run on. Depending on the supplied artifact it may be written using the timestamps from the original computer's timezone or it may be written in predefined timezone, such as UTC.</p>
<p>If the &quot;-z local&quot; timezone is chosen the tool will print the found local timezone.</p>
<p>The option -z list prints out a list of all available timezones that can be chosen.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="z_zone_timezone2" class="item"><strong>-Z|-Zone TIMEZONE</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option defines the timezone that is used in the output module of the tool. The default value for this variable is the same value that is defined in the -z option or the timezone of the host. This option is used so that output modules can output in a different timezone than the host is in, for instance to output in UTC even though the timezone of the host is in another timezone.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="t_temp_dir2" class="item"><strong>-t|-temp DIR</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option defines the temporary directory the tool uses. By default the front-end does not set the temporary directory, but allows the engine to automatically detect it. This option therefore overwrites the default temporary directory location.</p>
<p>The engine checks the operating system in question, if it is Windows, it will try to determine the temporary path based on the Win32::API (so this might fail on 64-bit systems, perhaps better to use this option to set it manually on those systems). Otherwise it will use /tmp/ as the temporary directory (should work on *NIX systems).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="log_filename2" class="item"><strong>-log FILENAME</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Specify a file to write error and information messages from the <strong>log2timeline</strong> to a file, otherwise STDERR will be used.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="c_calculate2" class="item"><strong>-c|-calculate</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If this option is used then a MD5 sum is calculated for the file and stored in the timestamp object</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="x2" class="item"><strong>-x</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p><strong>log2timeline</strong> will by default try to run a minimized test on the input file to determine if it is of the correct structure.  For instance only to test the first byte to see if it matches.  This could lead to some files not being detected by log2timeline.  Therefore the -x option is provided to skip this pre-test and move directly to a more comprehensive test that is otherwise done after the pre-test is successful.  This might lead to fewer false positives, but in turn makes the tool a bit slower.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="v_version2" class="item"><strong>-V|-Version</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Display the version number of the tool <strong>log2timeline</strong> and exit with the exit code 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="h_help2" class="item"><strong>-h|-help|-?</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Display a help message explaining the available options to the tool (a simple version of this man page).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="e_exclude_list2" class="item"><strong>-e|-exclude LIST</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>A comma separated list of files to exclude from the scan.  If a particular file has caused the tool to crash or not work, or you simply want to exclude some documents from the scan it is possible to exclude some</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>log2timeline -f winvista -r -z local -e 'Windows-Diagnosis,secret[0-3]' /mnt/windows</em></p>
<p>This would scan all the directory /mnt/windows recursively, using only modules associated to a Windows Vista or later operating system, and excluding all filenames that have &quot;Windows-Diagnosis&quot; in them or contain the word secret0/secret1/secret2 or secret3 in it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="r_recursive2" class="item"><strong>-r|-recursive</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This option makes <strong>log2timeline</strong> work in a recursive way, the same behaviour as timescanner.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="p_preprocess2" class="item"><strong>-p|-preprocess</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>If <strong>log2timeline</strong> is working in recursive mode (-r) it is possible to use the -p option to run a set of pre-processors agains the image file.  Preprocessors are modules that search through the suspect drive and extract needed information that can be used in other modules, such as hostname, etc.</p>

<dd>
<p>Use the Firefox 3 history parser to parse a places.sqlite file that contains history information.  Prepened the output with information about the user that owned the file, in this case the user JOE owned this history file.  The output, which is in the TLN format will be written to the file body, while all log messages are written to the file body.log (STDERR is redirected to a file)</p>

<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>As of now there are no known bugs, and when bugs are either discovered or reported they are fixed as soon as possible
and made available in the nightly builds.</p>
<p>If you find a bug in the tool, please start by downloading the latest build (nightly builds) available at 
<a href="http://log2timeline.net/files/log2timeline_nightly.tgz">http://log2timeline.net/files/log2timeline_nightly.tgz</a> to verify that the bug hasn't already been fixed and if it
hasn't please report the problem to Kristinn Gudjonsson (bugs ( a t ) log2timeline ( d o t ) net.</p>
<p>There are few known limitations though:</p>
<p>+ The LSO (.sol) input module isn't able to properly parse every .sol file it finds.  The payload of a .sol file is
encoded using Action Message Format from Adobe.  There are two versions of AMF, AMF0 and AMF3.  The vast majority of
.sol files is encoded using the AMF0, however there are some that use AMF3.  The current version of the sol parser
only works against AMF0, however a version that supports AMF3 should be released in not so distant future.</p>
<p>+ There have also been reports about <strong>log2timeline</strong> not properly clean temporary files after completing it's run.  
This behaviour involves the input modules for Chrome and Firefox history.  If the input module detects a database that
is being locked, it copies the database to a temporary location to be able to connect and properly parse the file.  After
it has completed the parsing it will try to delete the temporary file using the Perl function unlink.  If you do have this
problem please notify the author to see if we can figure this out together and fix the problem.</p>
